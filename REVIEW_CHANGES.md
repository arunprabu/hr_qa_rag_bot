# Code Review Changes Summary

**Date**: 15 October 2025  
**Objective**: Fix AutoGen version inconsistency and improve code clarity

---

## 🎯 Main Issue Identified

### ❌ **Documentation showed "AutoGen 0.4+" but code uses AutoGen 0.7.5**

The project correctly implements AutoGen 0.7.5 in code and `requirements.txt`, but documentation referenced the older "0.4+" version. This has been corrected throughout.

## 📝 What Was Improved

### **Clarity Enhancements**

#### Before:
```python
def ask_question(self, question: str, top_k: int = 5) -> str:
    """Ask the HR assistant a question with RAG retrieval."""
    # Step 1: Generate embedding
    question_embedding = self.pdf_processor.generate_embedding(question)
```

#### After:
```python
def ask_question(self, question: str, top_k: int = 5) -> str:
    """
    Ask the HR assistant a question using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
    
    This method implements the complete RAG pipeline:
    1. Convert question to embedding vector
    2. Search vector database for relevant document chunks
    3. Build context from retrieved chunks
    4. Send context + question to AutoGen agent
    5. Return generated answer
    
    Args:
        question: Employee's question about HR policies
        top_k: Number of most relevant documents to retrieve (default: 5)
        
    Returns:
        Assistant's answer based on retrieved context
    """
    # Step 1: Convert question to embedding vector (1536 dimensions)
    question_embedding = self.pdf_processor.generate_embedding(question)
```

### **RAG Concept Explanations Added**

All major methods now include:
- ✅ What RAG is and why it's used
- ✅ Step-by-step pipeline explanations
- ✅ Vector dimension specifications (1536)
- ✅ Similarity scoring clarifications
- ✅ Context building rationale
- ✅ Prompt engineering insights

### **AutoGen 0.7.5 API Clarity**

Added comments highlighting:
- ✅ Modern async/await patterns
- ✅ CancellationToken usage
- ✅ AssistantAgent configuration
- ✅ AzureOpenAIChatCompletionClient setup
- ✅ Message handling with `on_messages`
